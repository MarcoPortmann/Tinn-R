### Tinn-R

This is a fork of the **Tinn-R Editor - GUI for R Language and Environment** maintained by José Cláudio Faria.

In particular, the project aims at (a) migrating the source code of Tinn-R to Delphi XE6, (b) adding a autosave/reload files on start function and (c) a code navigator for R to Tinn-R.


LANGUAGE: **Object Pascal**, IDE: **DELPHI XE6**.
